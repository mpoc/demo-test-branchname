title: Coursework 2
description: >
  For this coursework, you will have to implement a reinforcement learning
  algorithm. Your code will again be controlling Pacman, in the classic game,
  and the reinforcement learning algorithm will be helping Pacman choose how to
  move. Your reinforcement learning algorithm should be able, once it has done
  its learning, to be able to play a pretty good game, and its ability to play a
  good game will be part of what we assess.
